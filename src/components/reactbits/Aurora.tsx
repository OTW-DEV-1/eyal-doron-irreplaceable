/**
 * Drifting blurred colour blobs — the brand's "aurora" motif.
 *
 * The page mounts twelve of these, so compositor cost dominates. The key is
 * that the canvas ELEMENT is kept small and scaled up, rather than being
 * full-size:
 *
 *   `filter: blur()` forces the browser to allocate a second render surface at
 *   the element's rendered size. A full-viewport aurora therefore cost two
 *   ~1.4Mpx layers, and twelve of them accounted for most of a ~359MB GPU layer
 *   budget. Past that budget the compositor rasterises in tiles and culls
 *   anything outside its interest rect, which is what made the 3D gallery
 *   sphere paint in and drop out mid-rotation.
 *
 *   Instead the canvas is laid out at its backing-store size (<=360px) and
 *   scaled up with a transform. `filter` applies before `transform`, so the
 *   blur runs on the small surface and is scaled up with it — the blur radius
 *   is pre-divided so the on-screen result is unchanged. Layer area drops ~20x.
 *
 * The output is a heavy blur either way, so the upscale is invisible.
